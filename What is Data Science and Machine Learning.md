# What is Data Science?

# What is Machine Learning?

Artificial Intelligence is used in business through machine learning algorithms. Machine learning is a part of computer science focused on computer systems learning to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and learn how to make predictions and recommendations by processing data, rather than by receiving explicit programming instructions (‘if-then’ loops). The algorithms improve over time with new data coming in, ‘learning’ through examples.

> Machine learning is primarily used in:

- **Descriptive**: _What happened_?
- **Prescriptive**: _What should be done to achieve goals_?
- **Predictive**: _What will happen_?
