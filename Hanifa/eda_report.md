# Problems:

- Graph / Visual titles were missing.
- Graphs were not acquainted with labels.
- Data was not correctly formatted before processing.
- Price contains neg values which should be corrected.
- There were not enough visuals/graphs for representing data.

# Things to remember: 

_**EDA is a philosophy as to how we dissect a data set; what we look for; how we look; and how we interpret!!!!!**_

- Before starting EDA, data should be correctly formatted ( for e.g Year should not be taken as float and must be formatted to int before EDA).
- There should be enough visuals for describing data.
- The EDA should have representations for “highest of all Parameters”.
- Make sure to use Count and Percentage for every insight. 
- Insights should be there in EDA.
- Insights should be properly numbered.
- Values should be sorted according to Percentage from highest to lowest (alphabetical sorting is done when it is explicitly stated)
- Where there is null use –
- Be careful about the negative values.
- Make sure that charts and graphs are readable.
- Make sure that charts are properly labeled.
- Graphs should have titles (Titles should depict what we need to look at in graph)
- Insights Data representation should follow a pattern : from single dimensional to multi-dimensional.
- In case of multi-dimensional representation, Crosstab should be used which is a core DS activity.
- In EDA, use gradient to highlight data (Red when there are warning signs, Green when we have achieved something pro-actively, Blues when we are in the range of budgeted or forecasted numbers)
